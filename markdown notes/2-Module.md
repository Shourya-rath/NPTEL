<!-- 
Paras can be having different kinds in terms of How they deliver the information
Simple - just direct info   -> Have to directly Know that shit as a fact 
Composite - Some shit that is made up of different Info -> H. to Break It Down
Multi Value - It can be written differently -> then the essence should be captured 
Single Value - Close to simple , but in this case this is Hard Fact , it is the essence itself 
-->

## Types of Attributes
- Simple - Composite 
- Single Valued -  Multivalued ( double circle )
- Derived ( dashed )

## Composite and Multi-Valued - Domains
- Domain of a composite attribute is the Cross Product (Cartesian product) of the domains of its component attributes.
- Domain of a Multi-Valued attribute is the set of subsets of values from its basic domain.

2. Suppose R is a relationship type with two participating entity types E1 and E2. The
number of entities in E1 and E2 are 2 and 4, respectively. How many different non-empty
relationship sets are possible in this case?

3. Suppose X is a composite attribute of an entity type and has three components - C1 ,C2 and C3, where C1 and C2 are multi-valued. If domain sets of C1, C2 and C3 have 2, 3, and 5elements respectively, what is the size of the domain of X?

6. Consider a binary relationship Existsln between entity types City and State . It records 1 point
as to which city is located in what state . Suppose the cardinality ratio constraint of the this
relationship is expressed using (min,max) notation as (u ,v) on the line connecting City to Existsln
and (x,y) on the line connecting State to Existsln, which one of the following is correct: (Assume that the capital of any state is a city) .

(u ,v) = (1, 1 ); (x,y) = (O,N) 

(u,v) = (1,N); (x,y) = (1,1)

(u,v) = (1,1); (x,y) = (1,N)

(u,v) = (1,N); (x,y) = (0,N)
